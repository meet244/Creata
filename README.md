# Creata - AI Generated Images

[Creata](https://creata.vercel.app/)✨ is a project that showcases my UI and API skills, allowing you to create stunning AI-generated images effortlessly.🖼️

## Website Demo

## What is Creata?

Let me introduce you to [Creata](https://creata.vercel.app/)✨- my latest project. It's where I've harnessed the magic of API scraping. I've scraped an API from a fantastic AI image generative model, and made it available for everyone, free of charge, and without any time constraints!🔮📸

Now, you have the power to unleash your creativity with Creata and create captivating images. 🎨💥

## How Creata Works

I've scraped an API from Craiyon.com🪄 and used it to build a website with a Flask backend. This website calls the scraped API to generate AI images. While the project works flawlessly when cloned and used locally, it may face deployment issues online. Unfortunately, I'm not sure why this happens, but feel free to explore the project.🤔
